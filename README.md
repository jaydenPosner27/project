#Python project that ranks all songs in an album based on user input

##This project gives users the ability to search for any album, collects the song titles via an API, and allows the user to rank them. A sorting algorithm is used to automatically give each song a number score without the user needing to assign it. This project was built to practice my skills in Python, and because I always wanted to use a program like this but never could find one

##Technologies used:
-Python
-Last.fm API
