# Song Ranker

A Python project that ranks all songs in an album based on user input.

## Description
The Song Ranker program allows users to search for any album, collects the song titles via the Last.fm API, and automatically ranks them using a sorting algorithm. Users do not need to assign scores manually as the program generates numerical scores for each song.

This project was built to practice Python programming and working with APIs, as well as to create a tool that I personally wanted to use.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Last.fm API
- Requests library
